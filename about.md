	<p class="intro">My name is Lukas, KD9A and I'm 14 years old. I live near Boise, Idaho. I enjoy Ham radio, electronics design, and mountain biking!</p>
	<p>I first got interested in Ham radio because my Uncle (KG7QCC), Cousin (AF7QR), and I were interest in communication with satellites and high altitude balloons. Since many Ham radio balloon and satellite projects have been formed, and you need a license in order to use the frequencies that the operate on, it seemed natural that we should get our licenses. After studying with <a href="http://hamradiolicenseexam.com">HamTestOnline</a>, in January 2015 we got our Technician licenses, at that time I was 12 years old. After studying for my general, once again with HamTestOnline, we took the test in March 2015. In April 2015 my cousin and I took our extras and passed. Since then I have been active on hf and vhf.
